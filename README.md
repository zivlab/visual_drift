#  Representational drift in the mouse visual cortex
This repository includes analyses and processed data presented in Deitch et al., 2021.

## Usage and documentation
Scripts are provided in the *scripts* directory. Data sets are provided in the *data* directory.</br>
Note that the provided data sets are a processed version of the publicaly available neuronal data published in de Vries et al., 2020 and Siegle et al., 2021.

To perform the analysis on the provided data sets, use the *visual_drift_analysis.m* script.
Before running the script, change the pathway in *scripts_path* and *data_path* variables to the pathway of the corresponding *scripts* and *data* directories on your computer.
